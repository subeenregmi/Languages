Mostly the / -> sign means integer division, so 5/9 would truncate to zero.
To overcome this use 5.0/9.0.

printf("<string> %d, %i", <decimal>, <int>);
	- The decimal provided after the string will replace the %d, so will the integer.
	- use an integer after percentage sign, e.g: %6d, to print the characters in a field 6 digits wide
	- if you use a floating point number instead of an int infront of the percentage, then it has other meanings:
	- %3.0f ==> atleast 3 characters wide with no decimal point and no fractional digits
	- %3.1f ==> ateleast three characters wide, with 1 digit after decima l

	- %o - octal
	- %x - hexadecimal
	- %c - character 
	- %s - string
	- %% - for a percent sign

for loop 
---------

for(int i=0; i<4; i++)
The first step is initialisation, second is evaluation, last is incrimentation

The code is run before the incrimentation stage if the evaluation is successful. 

define
------

#define NAME <value>

This will replace all instances of NAME to value at compile time.

Character Input and Output =+

A text stream is a sequence of characters divided into lines; each line consists of zero or more characters followed by a new line character.

chars are interpreted as integers of their actual ASCII value

use #include <stdbool.h> to use bool values.

strings are used as such char[] string = "hello world"

Functions
-------------------

return-type function-name(parameters){
	body
	return <return-type>
}

function declaration or prototype is just the name of the function and its parameters,
